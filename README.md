## Disabling Javascript should not break a corporate website ...

I did not want to keep rewrite or hack a responsive menus each time I was doing a
corporative site. 1-2% may not sound a lot of client/visitor loss, but on a 
corporate site, loosing 100-200 or 1000-2000 visitors a month because of
Javascript is bad.


### .. but this code requires a modern browser

This is using modern CSS3 features compare to what I am used to use for 
corporative sites, which can also be bad experience if visitors users are still 
using a older browser which could break the mobile-layout.


## Testing and Feedback

This code have been tested and works in recent versions of Firefox, Chrome,
Safari and Opera on OSX and Linux (Fedora/Ubuntu). This have not yet been tested
in a Windows-enviroment or Internet Explorer. Feedback is welcome.

*I would like to try and make the code work in Internet Explorer 11 in order to
support some type of backwards compatability.*
